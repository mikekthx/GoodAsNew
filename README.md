# Good As New 💰🔧

Automatically sells your junk items and repairs your gear!  
Let the guild pay the bill, or handle it yourself like a pro.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Sells all **gray-quality junk** from your bags when visiting a vendor.
- Automatically **repairs your gear** — with your gold or your guild's. Option to only use guild funds while in a raid group.
- Optional: Hold a **modifier key** to skip repairing.
- Fully configurable in the **Interface > AddOns** panel.

## 🔧 Features

- 🛠️ Auto Repair (personal or guild bank)
- 💸 Auto Junk Sell (except for the legendary [Noboru's Cudgel] — we know better!)
- 🗨️ Optional chat messages
- 🎨 Choose how gold is displayed in chat: `12g 34s 56c`, `12 Gold 34 Silver 56 Copper` or classic coin icons
